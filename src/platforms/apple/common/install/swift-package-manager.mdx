title: Swift Package Manager (SPM)
---

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git`, and select a version (or branch) on the next page.

<Note><markdown>

Version tags or branches need to have the `Package.swift` file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package.
