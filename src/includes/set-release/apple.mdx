The SDK will automatically pick up the release version of your application. If you wish to override it, you can do so with `releaseName`:

```swift
SentrySDK.start(options: [
    "dsn": "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    "releaseName": "my-project-name@2.3.12"
])
```

```objc
[SentrySDK startWithOptions:@{
    @"dsn": @"___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    @"releaseName": @("my-project-name@2.3.12")
}];
```
